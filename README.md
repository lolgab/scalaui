## Getting Started
Once you have setup your Scala Native project and enviroment, you have to compile [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui) and, on linux, copy the `libui.so.0` and `libui.so` files to /usr/lib (probably you need to change their permissions too).

Then you have to add the following to your build.sbt:

 ```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.lolgab" %%% "scalaui" % "0.0.1"
 ```
(there is no release yet, you have to publishLocal the library to let it work!)

Then you can import scalaui:

```scala
import scalaui._
```

We want to create a simple window with a button that prints "Hello World!" on the console when clicked.

First you have to define a method which will be executed everytime the button is clicked:

```scala
def greeting(): Unit = println("Hello World!")
```

Then you create a button in your `Main` object, passing a name and the method name followed by a `_`:
```scala
val button = new Button("My Button", greeting _)
```

Then you create a window passing the button as content:

```scala
val window = new Window("My Window", width = 200, height = 200, content = button)
```

Then you can actually trigger the creation of the window with all its components in your main method:

```scala
def main(args: Array[String]) = {
  scalaui.render(window)
}
```
You now should see a nice window with a button, let's click it:
